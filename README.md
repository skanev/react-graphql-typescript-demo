# React + TypeScript + GraphQL demo

A very tiny Next.js application with code I used for a presentation. It's a huge
mess on many levels and a lot of the things are not best practice.

If you weren't there, please ignore.

If you were:

1. Do a `yarn install` or whatever
2. Add an `env.local` with `NEXT_PUBLIC_GRAPHQL_KEY` as your API key
3. Run `yarn dev` and have fun

If you want to make a change and regenerate the types either (1) install perl
and run the `.sh` scripts or (2) figure out how to do it properly ;)
